# Quote-Gen

Very basic quote generator whilst working on FreeCodeCamp JS curriculum.

I had a number of things I wanted to achieve

1. Use of purely TailwindCSS and no internal CSS at all
2. Use of JS to hit API and return quotes

This will be amended over time as I work through the further modules as I need to refactor it down the line to fit their own task of using react.
